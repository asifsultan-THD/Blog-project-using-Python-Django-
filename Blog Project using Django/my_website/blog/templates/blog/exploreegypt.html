<h1>About Egypt</h1>

    Now, tell me why you would not want to visit Egypt? ðŸ˜›
    If the ancient Egyptians are known for one thing, other than their elaborately built pyramids, itâ€™s their perfectly preserved mummies, which provide us with a window into the past. Several mummies originating during this period of time stand out, such as those of King Tut and Seti I, but the mummified remains of Ramesses III are the most mysterious.Ramesses III was a pharaoh who dutifully served Egypt during the 20th dynasty. For over a millennium, scholars have fiercely debated the events leading to his death. Thankfully, his body was treated with a complex array of different treatments following his death that preserved his mortal remains.
