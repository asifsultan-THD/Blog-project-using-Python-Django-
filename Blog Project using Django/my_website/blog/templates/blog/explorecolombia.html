<h1>About Colombia</h1>

        Colombia is one of the most incredible countries in the world. With chilled surfing beaches, crazed parties, bustling cities, lost cities, and incredible scenery, Colombia is a country which should be on every backpackers’ wishlist. Backpacking Colombia is truly an amazing experience.

        When I first arrived in Colombia, I was amazed at how safe everything felt. There is a strong, yet friendly, police presence and locals, in general, are extremely friendly. Traveling in Colombia is a bit more expensive than I had at first anticipated but if you’re smart it’s still possible to get around on the cheap.

        I strongly recommend booking accommodation in advance during the high season. This Colombia travel guide teaches you the ropes about how to have an amazing backpacking trip to this land of magical realism.

        Colombia is a country rich in ecological and cultural diversity. It is all at once a giant party and adventure central, and can also be mellow and peaceful, once you get away from all of the noise. The big cities are famous for their nightlife, all night parties, and of course, dancing. Each city has its own unique flavor, colorful buildings, and colonial architecture. The coast is brimming with beautiful post-card beaches and the attractive locals to match. The coastal areas have plenty of awesome places to go surfing or diving too.

        The mountainous, humid, super green interior is a whole other world of Colombia. Think dense jungles, rivers, lost ancient cities, and remote indigenous communities. No matter what your idea of a good time is, there is something interesting and fun to get into around every corner. Modern-day Colombia is a place thriving after decades of trauma inflicted by narco-traffickers, guerrilla activity, corruption and general political instability.

        Backpacking in Colombia is one hell of an adventure. Now let us take a look at some of the best Colombia backpacking itineraries to help you get an idea of where to go and what to do in this truly special country.

        Fly into Bogota, Colombia’s capital and enjoy the amazing food and nightlife. Head over to Barichara, a picturesque town. Then take the long bus to San Gil, an adventurer’s paradise. Here you can kayak, paraglide, and bungee jump!
