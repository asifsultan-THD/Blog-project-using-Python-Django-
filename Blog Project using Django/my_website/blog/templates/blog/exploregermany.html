<h1>About Germany</h1>
No backpacking trip to Germany is complete without backpacking Berlin, easily the edgiest city I’ve ever been to with arguably the best nightlife scene in Europe. The food scene has plenty of variety and it’s always evolving. Check out the Vietnamese, Turkish, hamburger, and vegetarian scene. I know, not traditional Germany, right? But nothing in Berlin is traditional, and Berliners pride themselves on that.

I recommend spending at least a week in Berlin because it’s a huge city and many of its neighborhoods and attractions are scattered throughout the city. Summers are a great time for outdoor events, concerts, and beer gardens, many of which close for the winter. For more information on where to stay in Berlin, check out this  .

Every neighborhood has some type of great park, usually with a beer garden close by. My favorite is Mauerparkin Prenzlauer Berg because of its famous popular Sunday Flea Market. Tiergarten near Brandenberg Gate is Berlin’s “Central Park.” It’s massive and a great place to bike ride, picnic, or jog. You can even do all this naked in some areas… Viktoria Park in Kreuzberg is a nice, quiet area to take a stroll and have a picnic. and Tempelhof Park in Neukölln is an old airport turned park. There are wide open spaces for kite surfing and land sailing, and you can run and bike on the old airport runaways. Plus, it’s a great place to grill and picnic!

There are countless historical sites and museums to see in Berlin, and it would take you months to visit them all. I recommend picking a few within a topic that interest you, like The Third Reich, Cold War, Modern Art, etc. Many of Berlin’s museums are congregated in the Mitte district. My personal favorite history museum in Berlin is the Jewish Museum in Kreuzberg. It’s incredibly sad, and also incredibly well put together, and you’ll learn a lot here.

The Reichstag is one of Germany’s most iconic buildings, and it’s free to visit, but make sure to reserve your spot. Spots sell out weeks in advance. My favorite historical site is a bit out of the way and off the beaten path, but so, so worth it. For 8 euros you can explore an old Cold War American spy station that was used to keep tabs on East Berlin. It’s built upon an old WWII rubble that the Allies couldn’t destroy. Now forests and grassy hills have built over the rubble. Talk about symbolism.

Berlin’s multiculturalism and acceptance can be reflected in their variety of cuisines. Kreuzberg is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey, so there are a lot of great Turkish restaurants here, as well as a budding vegetarian scene. (Check out Café V!)

And no trip to Berlin is complete without checking out it’s non-stop nightlife. Every day of the week there is always at least one club open for 24 hours, so theoretically you could party here forever… Many clubs are built in multi-room warehouses. Some are open-air, along the river, etc. Locals use Resident Advisor to stay in the know of where each party is that night.

My main advice for clubbing in Berlin is to dress casually. The best outfit is a black shirt and black jeans with black Nike’s or low-key sneakers. And avoid speaking English in line; the bouncers don’t like drunk tourists, and it’s pretty hard to get into a lot of clubs without a German native. If you don’t get in, just know there’s probably another great club around the corner.

Best Neighborhoods in Berlin
I recommend picking your hostel or Airbnb based on its neighborhood.

Kreuzberg: a hipster, slightly gentrified neighborhood with a large Turkish population. There are tons of great restaurants and bars here, and you’re within walking distance to a lot of nightclubs. You’re also walking distance from the East Side Gallery, and close to many touristic attractions by metro.

You’re better off finding an Airbnb in Kreuzberg, but there are a couple hostels in the area. Grand Hostel Berlin has a bar area with a welcome drink on arrival, it’s close to the U-Bahn, and has clean beds, and friendly staff!

Prenzlauer Berg: This area is also slightly gentrified and home to a lot of hip families. There are a ton of great restaurants, cafes, and shops here, and well as Mauerpark, a must visit for their popular Sunday flea market. You are nearby the touristy areas by metro.

While there aren’t any hostels in the heart of Prenzlauer, Circus Hostel is pretty close. Built in an old brewery, this hostel has a café and bar onsite. The hostel is clean, and close to public transportation!

Neukölln: This neighborhood is out of the way of the typical tourist things, but it’s an up-and-coming neighborhood with some great cafes, cheap dive bars, and underground clubs. There are not any hostels in the Neukölln area, so I recommend getting an Airbnb instead. Try to book a place near Weserstrasse, which has a great bar scene on weekends.

Mitte: This literally means “centre.” It’s a touristy, cosmopolitan area, and central to all. Tiergarten is a huge park you can visit in between museums. Stay in Mitte if you are just trying to see as many famous landmarks and museums as possible. Otherwise, I recommend staying in another area of Berlin. This is also where you’ll find Museum Island, which incorporates several of Berlin’s top museums. You can also go up Fernsehturm TV tower for a great view, but it’s sort of pricey.

There are plenty of hostels in Mitte to choose from, but I recommend Wombat City Hostel. The rooms are spacious and clean. They have a rooftop bar and happy hour, and this hostel is in a central location!
