<h1>About India</h1>
  <br/>
    Probably the most famous place in all of India and a magnet for hippie wannabes and all kinds of backpacker assholes, Goa is a complicated, chilled, paradoxical place that is well worth a visit no matter what you hear. The trick with Goa is making sure you find yourself upon the right beach! I&#39ve checked out almost every beach in Goa and my two favourites are Palolem and Patnem in the South. I recommend staying in Roadhouse Hostel on Palolem.

Both Palolem and Patnem are pretty relaxed and, assuming you have a motorbike or a scooter, within easy reach of some of Goa&#39s parties. You can arrange fishing, dolphin watching and kayaking from the beach. There is a huge range of accommodation options on offer â€“ the nicest beach huts are at Roundcube Patnem but they are a tad more expensive.

Another beach well worth a visit is Arambol beach in the North; be sure to check out the Cheeky Monkey Restaurant and, if you dig this kind of thing, catch the nightly yoga and tai-chi sessions on the beach. The Green Garden Restaurant in Arambol is super friendly and a great place to meet people, there&#39s lots of super cheap huts behind it.

Two day hike from Leh
Keen to see some of the Ladakhi mountains, I thumbed a lift to Zingchen (which took forever because nobody was going that way) and spent six hours walking into the mountains towards Rumbak, crossing the river many times as I followed the frequently weaving, sometimes disappearing, path. Rocking up to Rumbak, I was able to arrange a homestay in a matter of minutes for 450RS per person which included plenty of food. The next day, waking early, I took some diamox and assaulted an endless switchbacking trail up to a 4800 metre pass. I spent a few frozen moments on top, watching the prayer flags flap fiercely in the wind and then made my way down the other side to Stok where I caught the 5pm bus back to Leh. I carried warm clothes, chlorine tablets for purifying water, diamox for altitude sickness and emergency food.Rumbak to Stok took me seven hours, I didn&#39t have a map and I was fairly lost on a couple of occasions.
